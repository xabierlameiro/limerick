# Rent in partner - Rip Limerick - Rip ie Limerick

## Open Lettter

Hello, this is the beginning of my "blog". I will be writing about the difficulties of renting a property in Ireland in the current times.
I have decided to call this section RIP Limerick for two reasons, firstly, because we are a couple looking to rent a house in limerick and
secondly because we may have to go back to Spain to rest in peace because it is impossible.

I have been working as a web developer for more than 5 years and I have been working 100% remote for 2 years, this year I made the decision
to move to Ireland with my girlfriend to continue working from there but in a totally new country for me.

I want to get to know the Irish culture and also to improve my English, which I really need. My surprise is that after buying the tickets,
a course of more than half a year for both of us, I have seen that there is a serious problem with the accommodation. I had read about such a problem,
but I didn't think it could be of such magnitude.

Right now, I am hoping that the family that is hosting us for the first two weeks after our arrival will be able to extend our stay so that we
don't end up on the street.

I hope that a landlord or someone who is looking for flatmates might read this and get in touch with us.

We are two adults who have been together for more than 11 years. I work at home 39 hours a week in a very big company in the technology sector
with a permanent contract. This means that you will never have a problem with me when it comes to payments. We are calm, orderly and very friendly.
