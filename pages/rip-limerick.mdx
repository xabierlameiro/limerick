## Open Lettter

Hello, this is the beginning of my "blog". I will be writing about the difficulties of renting a property in Ireland in the current times.
I have decided to call this section **RIP Limerick** for two reasons, firstly, because we are a couple looking to **_R_**ent a house **_I_**n **_P_**artner and
secondly because we may have to go back to Spain to **_R_**est **_I_**n **_P_**eace because is to die for.

I have been working as a web developer for more than 5 years and I have been working 100% remote for 2 years, this year I made the decision
to move to Ireland with my girlfriend to continue working from there but in a totally new country for me.

I want to get to know the Irish culture and also to improve my English, which I really need. My surprise is that after buying the tickets,
a course of more than half a year for both of us, I have seen that there is a serious problem with the accommodation. I had read about such a problem,
but I didn't think it could be of such magnitude.

Right now, I am hoping that the family that is hosting us for the first two weeks after our arrival will be able to extend our stay so that we
don't end up on the street.

## Limerick

There is a severe shortage of rented accommodation in Limerick city, which has led to students having to live in unsuitable, overcrowded and expensive accommodation.
This is a major problem for students, as it can impact their studies and mental health. There are a number of reasons for the shortage of rented accommodation,
including the recent economic recession, which has led to people losing their homes and investors withdrawing from the market. The government needs to take action
to address this issue, as it is having a negative impact on students' lives.

### Dublín

Rent in Dublin can be quite expensive, depending on the area you choose to live in. For example, a one bedroom apartment in the city centre could cost you upwards of
€1,500 per month. However, if you are willing to live a bit further out from the city, you can find more affordable options. For example, a one bedroom apartment in
the suburbs could cost you around €800 per month.

### Southern Ireland

It's no secret that there's a housing crisis in Southern Ireland. The country has been struggling to keep up with demand for years,
and the situation has only gotten worse in recent months. The problem is two-fold: there's not enough housing being built, and the prices of
the homes that are available are skyrocketing.

The Irish government has been trying to address the issue, but so far, their efforts have been insufficient. The country needs tens of thousands of new homes,
but only a few thousand are being built each year. And, to make matters worse, the prices of homes are rising so quickly that many people are being priced
out of the market entirely.

The government has promised to do more to increase the supply of housing, but it remains to be seen whether they'll be able to make a dent in the problem.
In the meantime, the housing crisis is putting a strain on families, businesses, and the economy as a whole.

### Northern Ireland

According to a recent report by the National Housing Federation, Northern Ireland is facing a serious housing shortage.
The report estimates that there are currently around 4,000 homeless people in the region, and that this number is set to rise in the coming years.

The housing shortage is being caused by a number of factors, including the ongoing Troubles, which have led to many people fleeing their homes;
the growing number of people aged over 65; and the fact that many young people are now choosing to stay at home with their parents rather than moving out.

The lack of affordable housing is also a major problem, as many people are unable to afford to buy or rent a property. This is leading to an increase in
homelessness and is putting a strain on local services.

The government is aware of the problem and is working to address it. However, the scale of the problem is such that it is likely to take many years to resolve.
In the meantime, local charities and organisations are working to provide support and accommodation for those who are homeless.

We are two adults who have been together for more than 11 years. I work at home 39 hours a week in a very big company in the technology sector
with a permanent contract. This means that you will never have a problem with me when it comes to payments. We are calm, orderly and very friendly

I hope that a landlord or someone who is looking for flatmates might read this and get in touch with us.
